### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cassie Nutter

I am a data analyst and data scientist who enjoys diving into all the small details to find the big results.

I enjoy making compelling and insightful data visualizations.

You can find me relaxing with my dogs, playing DnD with friends, running around Austin, or tending to my houseplants.
